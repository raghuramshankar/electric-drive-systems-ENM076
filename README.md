## Computer Tasks: Implementation of Field Oriented Control of PMSM and IM

In this assignment, the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine(PMSM) and Induction Machine(IM) were modelled in d-q coordinate systems and field oriented control in d-q coordinated system was implemented. Also, rotor flux sensor, current model and voltage model sensorless control of IM was simulated.

The assignment involved four main tasks: 
- Modelling of PMDC as RL circuit and implementation of current and speed control using PI Controller.
- Modelling of PMSM in d-q coordinate system and implementation of current and speed control using PI controller.
- Modelling of IM in d-q coordinate system, implementation of current and speed control using PI controller.
- Implementation of current model and voltage model Statically Compensated Voltage Model(SCVM) rotor flux angle sensor.
